I‚Äôm a front-end web developer with a strong passion for creating clean, responsive, scalable, and user-focused interfaces. With over 3 years of hands-on experience, I‚Äôve worked on real-world projects using technologies like React.js, Next.js, TypeScript, AngularJS, and Java ‚Äî integrating APIs, managing state, and deploying applications.

I‚Äôm currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science and constantly exploring new tools, patterns, and best practices to improve my work. I also have experience with Git and collaborating with multidisciplinary teams in agile environments.

I‚Äôm always open to learning, sharing ideas, and contributing to exciting tech projects. Feel free to reach out! üëã
