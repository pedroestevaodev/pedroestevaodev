I'm a front-end web developer with a strong passion for creating clean, responsive, scalable, and user-centric interfaces. With over 3 years of hands-on experience, I have worked on real projects using technologies such as React.js, Next.js, TypeScript, AngularJS, and Java, integrating APIs, managing state, and handling deployments.

Currently, I am pursuing a degree in Computer Science and am always seeking new tools, patterns, and best practices to enhance my work. I also have experience with Git and collaborating with multidisciplinary teams in agile environments.

I am always open to learning, exchanging ideas, and contributing to interesting projects in the tech field. Feel free to get in touch! 👋
